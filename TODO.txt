- split runs with multiple perturbations
- Integrate yaw angle for lane change runs in the gym
- Make sure calcs work for most runs otherwise give warnings or errors
- Write documentation
- check on whether the forward speed calcuation is correct. it seems to always
  be 2 to 3 m/s off from what the treadmill was set at.
- the time sync didn't work on run 466-470
- the lateral force is not always centered at zero, for example # 486, need a
  way to fix that
