- split runs with multiple perturbations
- Integrate yaw angle for lane change runs in the gym
- Make sure calcs work for most runs otherwise give warnings or errors
- Write documentation
- the time sync didn't work on run 466-470
- the lateral force is not always centered at zero, for example # 486, need a
  way to fix that
- 158, 159, 162, 163, 167, 168 should be "Balance"
- I'm missing videos 295-325
- the knee does not seem to come off in Run 309, change the note
- Run 584 Charlie forgot to hold his knees in, it is a nice demo of how much we
